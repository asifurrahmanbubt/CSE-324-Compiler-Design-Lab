# CSE-324 Compiler Design Lab

This repository contains solutions to various lab assignments for the Compiler Design course (CSE-324). Each assignment is implemented in C++ and includes programs for lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and other compiler design tasks.

## Lab Assignments

1. **Identifier Validation**: Program to identify whether the given lexeme is a valid identifier.
2. **Floating Point Validation**: Program to identify whether the given lexeme is a valid floating point.
3. **Exponential Number Validation**: Program to identify whether the given lexeme is a valid exponential number.
4. **Token Identification**: Program to identify all tokens from a given block of code.
5. **String Pattern Matching**: Program to identify strings under `abb`, `a*b+`, and `a.` patterns.
6. **Flex Token Identification**: Flex program to identify all tokens.
7. **LL(1) Parsing**: Program to construct LL(1) parsing.
8. **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Program to construct Recursive Descent Parsing.
9. **Yacc Calculator**: Yacc program to implement a calculator and recognize a valid arithmetic expression.

## Instructions

### Running the C++ Programs

Each C++ program is in a separate file. To compile and run these programs, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired C++ file.
3. Compile the program using `g++`:
   ```sh
   g++ -o program_name program_file.cpp
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
./program_name
